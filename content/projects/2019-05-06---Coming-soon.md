My goal for the projects section is to showcase some stuff that at least I think is cool. This section will likely have significantly less posts than the actual posts section, but I hope to talk about cool models I've built, detail things I've sewn, and maybe even show some recipes (if I ever am a good enough cook to have a recipe to call my own). I don't know much, but I do know a little. Or at least I now have a degree in a fancy degree-holder that says so.

So hold tight because the next 3 months are going to be the busiest of my entire life (ahhh 2 month trip and moving to NYC and starting a new job!!!?!!) but hey, I'm going to try and that's what counts, right?
