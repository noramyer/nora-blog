A couple years ago I swore off blogs, calling them pretentious and pointless. So naturally, I made one! I've finally got a blog up and running, which took forever because this semester was the busiest of my life. I thought second semester senior year was supposed to be a breeze, but someone lied to me. Maybe a business student. Kidding, okay that is the one and only business student joke I will ever make on this blog, I swear. Different fields, different experiences. Anyway, to start, I would like to share a quote found in one of the college code and cryptography textbooks:

> Another class who are great supporters of street music consists of ladies of elastic virtue and cosmopolitan tendencies.
>
> â€” Charles Babbage (1791 - 1871)

Babbage was credited with originating the concept of the first digital programmable computer, so that's why he made it in the textbook. Not sure why this quote made it in though, but I'll say the dude definitely had some strong opinions about all types of ladies. Granted that was centuries ago, but I thought his elegant description of :sparkles:ladies of the night:sparkles: was suiting for a young, modern millennial woman who ~~studies~~ studied computer science.

## The graduation

![graduation.png](/media/graduation.png)

To begin a quick summary of where I am in life, two days ago I officially graduated from college, along with over 12,000 other Buckeyes (!!!!). I would not recommend sitting through a spring graduation ceremony for one of the three largest colleges in the US because it turns out when you're graduating 12,000 students, it takes a long time. When I accepted my admission to Ohio State, I remember feeling resentment for months because I never thought I would go to an in-state, public school. The pressure put on kids in high school to attend prestigious schools is insane, and I will openly admit I was caught up in it. I will be forever grateful that I decided to go to Ohio State because it was the most humbling and financially sound decision I have ever made. Go Bucks!!

## The big trip

Tomorrow I leave for Europe, where I will spend the first month traveling with my friend from college to a few countries before heading to Croatia to do a work-exchange program for another month. All I have is a tiny carry-on, a book, a camera, and my old Surface so I can journal.

Below you'll find a rough schedule of my trip. For most legs I will be taking the train or ferry, and then there are a few flights in the mix.

```
5/09 - 5/15: France (Paris, Nice, Marseille)
5/15 - 5/18: Portugal (Lisbon)
5/18 - 5/22: Spain (Madrid, Barcelona)
5/22 - 5/29: Italy (Milan, Venice, Bologna, Florence, Rome)
5/29 - 6/03: Greece (Athens, Santorini)
6/03 - 6/05: Croatia (Dubrovnik)
6/05 - 7/02: Croatia (Zagreb)
```

## The big move

So what's next for me? I'll start work at Flatiron Health in August as a software engineer. You can [check them out here.](https://flatiron.com/) After a few weeks of bootcamp with all the other new grads, I'll get to preference a team and start working. This means I'll be moving to NYC at the end of July, and hopefully my Midwest charm survives because apparently it's a running joke for real New Yorkers to hate on "people flooding in from Ohio". Why Ohio? Are we that much worse than Indiana or Illinois?

## This blog

This all sounds fine and dandy, and writing it out makes it sound like I am a poster child for a successful college graduate, but it really doesn't feel like that. I thought when I accepted an offer from my top company I'd somehow feel validated in my decision to go to Ohio State or in all my hard work, but eh not really. It feels relieving to know I have a job, but other than that I don't feel much. A little excitement. But right now it mostly just feels like a lot of fucking work.

My goal for this blog is just to have fun honestly, and it isn't meant to be professional or anything. So there will likely be plenty of cussing (sorry Grandma). In fact I doubt I will ever share the link publicly, so if you know me and you stumbled upon this randomly, massive props to you because I didn't even add Google search engine optimization. I plan to journal everyday in Europe, so I will probably post an article per country with lots of pictures included for my family to keep track of me and know that I am still alive. Then when I get home, I have many article and project ideas about tech, cooking, thrifting (my first three loves) among other things.
