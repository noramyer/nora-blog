My name is Nora Myer, although technically I was born Eleanor, and if you have had the unfortunate luck to stumble upon my blog, hello. I am a lover of thrift stores, a passable cook, and a current computer science student who built this blog to showcase some cool projects I have done and talk about my life within the private confines of relatively unknown domain, this site. Since I am no longer a fan of social media (which maybe I will post about soon?), this is a way for me to share interesting stories or experiences with people close to me.

I grew up outside of Boston, which would make my boyfriend groan hearing that because _technically_ I was born in Worcester, MA which is far enough outside of Boston that it is no longer Boston. But the only place in MA that mid-westerners know is Boston, so I will stick to that. I moved to Cincinnati when I was around 8, and now live and go to school at Ohio State.

## A little bit more about me, professionally

I am an aspiring career woman, so it only makes sense I add a short blurb about my professional adventures thus far. Assuming everything goes to plan, I will graduate in a few months (May 2019) from Ohio State with a degree in computer science.

I did my first internship a couple summers ago at IBM in New York state, where I learned that there really exist places that have remained untouched since the 80's (kiiiiidddddinnnnggg ok sorry, I'm thankful for this opportunity). This was my first real job ever, and I knew _nothing_. Looking back I still can't believe anyone saw potential in me because  I had been through quite literally one semester as a computer science student.

Spring of junior year, I took the semester off from school and joined Root Insurance as an intern in Columbus as their then 66th employee. And I learned more from just 4 months there than the other 2.5 years combined I think. I credit my mentors and teammates for challenging me and making me fall in love with dynamic, small company culture. Then this past summer, I headed to Seattle to intern at Microsoft in D-LUX, Window's language translation organization.


## What's next for me

So then what's next for me? At the end of July, I will move to NYC to start a job as a software engineer at Flatiron Health. [Check them out!](https://flatiron.com/)
