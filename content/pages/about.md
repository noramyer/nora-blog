My name is Nora Myer, and if you have had the unfortunate luck to stumble upon my blog, hello. I am a lover of thrift stores, a passable cook, and a current computer science student who built this blog to showcase some cool projects I have done and talk about my life within the private confines of relatively unknown domain, this site. Since I am no longer a fan of social media (which maybe I will post about soon?), this is a way for me to share interesting stories or experiences with people close to me.

I grew up outside of Boston, which would make my boyfriend groan hearing that because _technically_ I was born in Worcester, MA which is far enough outside of Boston that it is no longer Boston. But the only place in MA that mid-westerners know is Boston, so I will stick to that. I moved to Cincinnati when I was around 8, and now live and go to school at Ohio State.

## What I like to do

I like to do many things, most of which aren't related to coding because, well, I have other hobbies, and after thinking conceptually all day about programming, I want to do more hands on things. Recently I have been into cooking thanks to both my boyfriend and some great cook books out there like Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. My end goal is to be able to cook mostly without recipes, just using technique and flavor knowledge. (All vegetarian food though, since I haven't eaten meat since my first week of freshman year way back when.)

I'm also an avid thrifter and swear by its healing properties, so much so that I go about once a week since it's relaxing to me. It started when I was in middle school as a way to fit in cheaply since I didn't have a ton of money, and has grown into a love and appreciation for vintage fashion and sewing. In fact, one of my 2019 resolutions is to not purchase any new clothing (excluding the stuff you probably should never buy second hand).

*Whistler, 2017.*

When I get the chance to, I enjoy skiing outside of Ohio, and I also love to hike. Thanks to my grandpa's obsession with national parks, I've been to almost 25 in the US.

## A little bit more about me, professionally

I am an aspiring career woman, so it only makes sense I add a short blurb about my professional adventures thus far. Assuming everything goes to plan, I will graduate in a few months (May 2019) from Ohio State with a degree in computer science.

I did my first internship a couple summers ago at IBM in New York state, where I learned that there really exist places that have remained untouched since the 80's (kiiiiidddddinnnnggg ok sorry, I'm thankful for this opportunity). This was my first real job ever, and I knew _nothing_. Looking back I still can't believe anyone saw potential in me because  I had been through quite literally one semester as a computer science student.

Spring of junior year, I took the semester off from school and joined Root Insurance as an intern in Columbus as their then 66th employee. And I learned more from just 4 months there than the other 2.5 years combined I think. I credit my mentors and teammates for challenging me and making me fall in love with dynamic, small company culture. Then this past summer, I headed to Seattle to intern at Microsoft in D-LUX, Window's language translation organization.


## What's next for me

So then what's next for me? At the end of July, I will move to NYC to start a job as a software engineer at Flatiron Health. [Check them out!](https://flatiron.com/)
